  it('POST /pizzas - Create a new pizza', function(done) {

    // In order to do that, we'll need the data to send to the endpoint, so let's write a minimal package which fulfills only the absolute base requirements from the DB model:
    const pizzaData = {
      customer: 'John Doe',
      crust: 'thin',
      sauce: 'tomato'

      .expect('Content-Type', /json/)

      // Sets the second expectation - that we get a 200 http response back, which is essentially the "all clear" code that confirms the call worked
      .expect(200)

      // Sets up our ability to inspect the response package we received back from the endpoint
      .then(response => {

        // Sets the third expectation - that the customer value is actually what we sent
        expect(response.body.customer).toEqual('John Doe');

        // We do the same for each value we sent, confirming it's in the response body, since the backend builds that from what it sent to the DB, not from what it received directly, making it a good check for whether our endpoint is communicating accurately with our database.
        expect(response.body.crust).toEqual('thin');

        // Same for our sauce - this is our sixth spec
        expect(response.body.sauce).toEqual('tomato');

        // Remember that pizzaId we created at the beginning? Now that we have a record confirmed by the DB, we can grab it's ID from the response body and store it to use in our later PUT and DELETE and GET:ID requests:
        pizzaId = response.body._id;
        // The done statement essentially just closes this spec so we can begin a fresh one of a different type, or on a different object or function
        done();
      });

  // A bit more interesting is our GET:ID request. We're fetching a specific record this time, so we'll use our test record from our POST request earlier - and the pizzaId we subsequently stored near the end of that test - to search for that exact record, that way the rest of our testing only affects the test record - this is a very common convention and best practice for testing in general - we never want to be running test functions on "real" data, or we run the risk of corrupting that data, and possibly far worse. We always want to start by testing whatever method will produce a new, bespoke record, and that way we can test all other functions on that record. As long as the test for our "DELETE" method is last, that means we have effectively zero cleanup to do  at the end; if not, we'll need to artificially create a DELETE call at the end of our test to ensure we have not left dummy data in our live db!

    // then, just like when we use the endpoint in production, we'll pass in an id after a slash at the end of our route path:
      .get(`/pizzas/${pizzaId}`)

      // thanks to the pizzaId we stored earlier, we can write that as a template literal so that as long as test 1 passes, that ID will exist, will be assigned, and will be dummy data - the three checkboxes we need to tick for safely and efficiently testing our app routes
      .set('Accept', 'application/json')
      .expect('Content-Type', /json/)
      .expect(200)

      // the rest is pretty much the same aside from, of course, the need to verify that the ID is also what we expect it to be, and has not been changed, and we have not accidentally performed the operation on the wrong record.
      .then(response => {
        expect(response.body._id).toEqual(pizzaId);

  it('PUT /pizzas/:id - Update a single pizza by ID', function(done) {
    const updatedPizzaData = {

        expect(response.body.sauce).toEqual('bbq');
        done();

  // finally, we'll test the DELETE method - and we do it last, so that our test record is available for the duration of our spec file execution, but does not persist after the test closes. Thus, our data integrity is absolutely protected.
